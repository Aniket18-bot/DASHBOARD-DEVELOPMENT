🎯 **Description**

This project is part of my **CODTECH Internship Program** under **Task-3: Dashboard Development**.

The objective of this internship task was to:

- Develop an **interactive Power BI dashboard** using the **Superstore dataset**.  
- Visualize key business metrics like **Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity, and Shipping Performance**.  
- Apply **data cleaning, transformation, and DAX calculations** for better insights.  
- Design multi-page dashboards for **Product, Customer, and Shipping analysis**.

By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Power BI Desktop** — data modeling, visuals, and report design.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** — creating calculated measures and KPIs.  
- **Data Visualization** — presenting business insights effectively.  
- **Interactive Dashboards** — using slicers, filters, and user navigation.

📊 **Visualizations**

The dashboard includes multiple interactive visuals such as:

- **Sales and Profit Trend Over Time**

- **Sales by Segment, Category, and Region**  
- **Top 10 Customers by Sales and Profit**  
- **Shipping Delay Analysis and Sales by Ship Mode**

This internship project strengthened my skills in **data analytics, visualization, and business intelligence using Power BI**.
